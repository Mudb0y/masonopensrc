OK, so you're a guy who's trapped in a crazy field full of robotic ccars and other strange devices.
Press left arrow to walk left, right arrow to walk right. you shouldn't need to walk left unless you missed an object or something, but well.
When you come across an object that sounds like a hum, it indicates a new level. They don't do much else, they just sit there.
When you hear an object that sounds like a cocking of a gun, it is a gun. Walk over it to pick it up. You do use that gun to make objects go away from you. but jump when you shoot, because the object can hit you. it just moves all objects on the board 30 spaces left, away.
When you hear an alarm sound coming towards you, just jump with up arrow over it. And the cars, you got to jump over also. And the "MTG Robot." He goes really, reeeeeally fast.
You can fly with F and D, F is right, D is left. C tells you your position.
Have fun:
Mason
