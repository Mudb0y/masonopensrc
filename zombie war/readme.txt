Welcome to the testing version of Zombie War by Sound Worx.

In human mode, your objective is to survive and find crates in a war of chaos. You have guards guarding the safe zone entrance as well as the hideout room entrance, but the hideout guards for some reason don't protect well, due to the nature of there location. Guards disappear after level 50 is reached.
No documentation for zombie mode yet.
Of course there may be bugs, just inform me of them if you find them.
