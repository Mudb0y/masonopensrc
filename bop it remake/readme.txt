Here is a new spin off of bop it. My goal with this was to make it as close to the original as I could mechanics wise.
Keys
B, bop it
p, pull it
t, twist it
s, spin it
f, flick it
if you modify scoreoption.dat and set it to 2, then scores will be read with voice. if you set it to 1, they will be sounded out like in the original. bop means 1, twist means 10, and spin means 5.
