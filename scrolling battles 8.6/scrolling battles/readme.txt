weapon info
Fists
Your hands aren't that strong, well, not as strong as a knife, right? You really don't want to use this unless you have to. But all the same, it is fun...
Knife
The knife is kind of like a sword. It is quite useful if you run out of ammo and have no other weapon to use.
gun
This weapon is similar to a single-shot pistol or somesuch.
Machine gun
This weapon is more like a fully automatic gun, such as an AK-47, M60, M16 and so on. Hold space to fire bursts of ammo, or press space once for a single shot.
Grenade launcher
Launches incredibly powerful grenades.
Pusher.
This item pushes the enemy left or right depending on which direction you are facing. Press F to check. Take a step in the direction
water blaster
This weapon shoots water in the direcction you are facing. if you turn around, the water moves the other way. say you face left, and shoot, then turn, it goes right. Like a hose, sort of.
player helper
a robot drone that will, as the name suggests, help you.  it will follow the enemy, as soon as one is spawned.  It uses a powerful punch.
laser
This nifty little laser weapon isn't the best out there, but it gets the job done.
teleporter
a weapon that, when fired, teleports you a certain amount of squares in 1 direction in which you are facing.

Store
When an item is successfully perchased, you hear bells ascending.
When item fails because you have it or it is full, you hear two low tones.
When you are out of money and try to bye an item, you hear a laser slash electricity type tone.
Pits.
If you happen to come across one of these while playing, don't worry. Just simply jump over them. Note: You'll know you've found a pit when you hear either: the sound of flames, lava, water or wind.
Extra notes on pits.
they will randomize every 45 seconds. 3 seconds beforehand, an alert tone goes off. when they change, you hear a swooshing sound.

Difficulty levels
You have normal and advanced. In advanced, pits respawn quicker, the enemy hits harder, the helper shoots slower, and various other stuff to make the game harder.

Event buffer
This buffer stores all kinds of events that may happen in your game. Use left and right brackets to review it! It can be kind of funny at times.
Soundpacks
There are sound packs that you can access from the settings menu, and you can create your own if you wish. 
Just go to settings, sound packs. Select one. Then, it switches, and is saved.
Minigame machine
Press P in any minigame to pause it.
When you finish a minigame, it pulls up a sort of dialog. Press enter to accept it or hit any arrow to repeat it.
Shooting range.
You wait for the item to reach the center, then you press space when you think it is there, and if it is, you get a few extra dollars! Play until it gets too fast for you!
press l to check your lives.

Minibeep
Walk left or right, then, when the beep is in the center, hit space! But, if the beep's pitch gets too low, it lands and takes away some of your health. if your health reaches 0, you're toast.
Note, the beep health has nothing to do with the sb health.
Audio fishing
Basically, similar to shooting range. You wait till the fish is swimming in the center, then hit space. You hear a sound and the fish stops swimming. Hit left or right control keys to reel him in. Then you move onto the next fish and it gets faster. Play till you die.
Fire escape
You basically have to run away from incoming fires! They move toward you and if you don't run fast enough they'll hit and kill you! Once you beat a fire, you are reset to 0 and it gets faster!
Hit left to move left, right to move right, c to check your position, and escape to quit.
Dice game
This is basically a random game. Completely. You press space to roll the dice, and a random thing will happen, and you will lose or gain money with that result. Hit s to check your score, M to check your money, P to check your position, H to check your houses, and C to check your computers.
Swimming
Basically, you hit up arrow to swim forward, and down arrow to swim backward. As you go, you will hear directions called every once in a while. When a direction is called, hit an arrow key corrisponding to that direction. Then, if you don't succeed, you will hit a wall and go back to the start. So be very careful! You win at position 500.
Destroy the door
Basically, go through the level, left and right, killing the doors. Each time a door is killed, you have another one spawning somewhere else. Find and kill that one. Once they are all dead, which is after 20 doors, then you win.
Hit D to check your number and how many doors are left.

Enjoy this free game!
