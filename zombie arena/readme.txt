Story.
It was just a normal day. You were doing work at the warehouse, everything was all fine. Then, suddenly, an alarm started to go off. A fire had caught in the warehouse! Immediately, things started bursting into flame without warning! You must run! Figure out what caused this fire!
level 1. Warehouse fire!
Note, avoid the fire, it will kill you. Once you get past 80, then it's fine to just hop down and take the door.
level 2. the attack
As you exit the warehouse, you see a swarm of men surrounding the entrance of the warehouse. Except, these aren't normal men. they're all ... scarred. And they look deformed slightly, very unnatural-looking men. almost like ... zombies?
