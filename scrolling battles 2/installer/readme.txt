Welcome to Scrolling Battles 2!
Story.
You were laying in bed one night, restlessly waiting for the next day. It was around 1 AM at your house, and you were not tired at all. You were just bored. You wanted to do something.
So, you got out of bed, put on some clothes, and walked out the front door. Standing on your front porch, you saw some guys trying to get into your neighbor's house. You snuck into your shed, grabbed your rifle, baseball bat, and your knife. You also grabbed a small hand gun, just in case. Then, you walked back outside. The guys were almost in the neighbor's house!
You loaded your rifle and gun, and walked up behind the first guy. You shot him in the head. He fell to the ground. The other guy looked over at you.
"Who dares to interrupt us while we're working?" said the guy.
You aimed the gun at him as well, but he was too fast for you. He grabbed you, and started walking. You struggled and managed to get away from him. But suddenly, you were whisked away by some invisible force. You land on some weird looking street. There was nothing that you could see at this point. You started walking. Then, suddenly, out of nowhere, 2 guys just materialized out of thin air. You shot them, but you wondered where they came from?
And there is where you take over.

Level descriptions.
Level 1. Quiet street.
just basically a street. You just walk to the end of it, and kill all the enemies, and you're good.
Level 2. The general store.
You are now in some kind of shop. The guys will still spawn here. Just kill them and continue on. A warning, they will be a bit faster here.
Level 3. Castle entrance.
You have discovered a door in the back of the store. You go through it, but are whisked away again. You land in a sort of wattery swampy kind of area. Way up ahead, you see another one of those teleporter things. Through that, you can see a door into some big huge castle type place. You wonder where that goes to.
Level 4. Castle hallway 1.
You have entered the castle now. You are standing in a sort of hallway. The sign next to it says "WELCOME, INTRUDER." But you aren't really that scared. Probably just those guys again...
level 5. Castle hallway 2.
You are in another hallway similar to the one you were in before. It's just a little more fragile sounding...
level 6
Oh god, it seems the teleporter has malfunctioned! You were supposed to end up in another boring corridor but instead you were placed right in the incinorator! There is a fire coming at you from the left, move as fast as you can to the end to escape it!
level 7
You are now in the second part of the incinorator. There will be a larger fire chasing after you this time. There will be a switch later in the level that you can hit to disable it, but note, it moves fast!
level 8. Final Corridor.
Well, the boss has a teleporter here and he hopes that it will redirect you to him. His teleporters are still quite unstable... Anyway, this seems to be the last level until you fight the boss! Prepare!
level 9. The boss.
He's big, He's ugly, and he's bad! He slowly walks towards you, but if you stay still, he will be at a run when he arrives at your position. Might as well go to him, while he's slower... Um, you might use your rifle or machine gun. Just a tip.
Level 10. Escape part 1. Corridor 1.
Well, back to fighting enemies for at least a while... This corridor is more metal, maybe it's more secure.
level 11. Exit of the castle.
You're back in the little wattery area, with all that stuff in it. Well, it looks like there's one more teleporter left. You can't see anything else there.
level 12. Final boss.
He might be a weak attacker, but he's not a weak boss. Good luck. It's Mason, from MTG Studios.
